I am a user experience researcher. I spend my days running and analyzing studies, talking about what I do to stakeholders and technical experts . 

I run team of user experience designers, project managers, developers, and electricians, to create tools that help them work on the field. 

I  completed my PhD in Human Computer Interaction at Inria Saclay, and a post doctoral year creating a digital experience for teachers as they prepare and run their sessions. 

I enjoy user research, protoyping, participatory design, co-design and deep reflection about interaction, and user-centered design.
