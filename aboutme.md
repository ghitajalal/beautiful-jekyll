subtitle: UX Researcher, Digital Enthousiast, World Explorer

I am a user experience researcher. I spend my days running and analyzing studies, with a team of user experience designers, project managers, developers, and electricians, to create tools that help them work on the field. 

I  completed my PhD in Human Computer Interaction at Inria Saclay, and a post doctoral year working on creating digital experiences for teachers. 

I enjoy user research, protoyping, participatory design, co-design and deep reflection about interaction, and user-centered design.
