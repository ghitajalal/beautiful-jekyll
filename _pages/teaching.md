I have always enjoyed teaching. During my Phd, I taught master level courses in computer science, database design, and HCI. My had backgrounds in engineering, design, social sciences and business. 

I am now a lead teacher at Ironhack. I teach user experience research, HCI, interaction design and prototyping. We work with methods like design thinking, agile, lean UX, and apply them to real life projects.


I like to provide my students with tons of ressources, references and tools. When we meet, my main goal is to give lots of examples, and tell lots of stories. Then, I work together with students to figure out which tool to solve which type of problem.
