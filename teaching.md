I have always enjoyed teaching. During my Phd, I taught master level courses in computer science, database design, and HCI. My students had backgrounds in engineering, design, social sciences and business. 

I am now a lead teacher at Ironhack. I teach user experience research, HCI, interaction design and prototyping. We work with methods like design thinking, agile, lean UX, and apply them to real life projects.


I like to provide my students with tons of ressources, references and tools. When we meet, my main goal is to give examples and tell stories. Then, we work together to figure out which tool to use to tackle which type of problems.
